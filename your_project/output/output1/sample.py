This code implements the necessary improvements as suggested by the original comments. Firstly, it changes the data structure storing the users from a list to a dictionary. This allows for quicker lookups. Secondly, it operates with a proper email validation using the built-in function `parseaddr` to parse the email address. Emails are considered valid if 'parseaddr' splits the adress into 2 parts and neither part is empty. Finally, the code to remove a user is refactored to take advantage of the dictionary data structure, allowing for efficient removals.
